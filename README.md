Todo App with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node
Overview
This is a simple Todo application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The application uses MongoDB as the database to store tasks, Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, Express as the backend framework, React for the frontend, and Node.js as the runtime environment.
